title: "Landing Page Guide Part 6: Collecting Emails"
---

It’s important to have a landing page, and a landing page can do many things for you. However, one of the chief uses for a landing page is to collect and build an email list. Why is this important?

Maybe you don’t have an app yet, but you want to validate the idea by gauging the demand. Many times, this can give you a huge boost in motivation to work on something. Or maybe you want to have a way to contact a very specific group of people who might enjoy future products you plan to build. In either case (and many others), email lists are one of the most valuable things you can have.

In this post, we will talk about email addresses, specifically how we will collect emails and send emails through MailChimp.

### Selecting a Service Provider: MailChimp or AWeber

The two most popular services to handle email lists and campaigns are MailChimp and AWeber. In this guide, we will focus on using MailChimp because they have a free option, while AWeber doesn’t. You can always switch to AWeber or another competitor once you’re up and running, but MailChimp doesn’t charge anything until you have at least 2,000 subscribers.

### Building a List

Assuming you’ve already signed up for MailChimp. We will talk about building a list and managing campaigns. The first thing to do is to create and name a list. This will be a list of people that have decided to share their emails with you.

Ideally, you’d want them to all come from the same or similar channel so that this list will have some meaning behind it. In other words, you want this to be a distinct group of people with traits and characteristics that you are familiar with so that you can better speak to them when you send out email campaigns later.

### Getting Emails

Once you have created a list in MailChimp, it’s time to get people on this list! There are several ways to do this. You can either use their form creator, generate a link and send it to people, or even manually add to the list itself.

## Form-based Sign Up

In their form creator, you can do a lot of different things to style your form and even collect additional information such as “First Name” or other information that can be used later in campaigns. One feature I like is that you can simply get the plain code from MailChimp and style it yourself on your webpage. There are numerous options here, but if you want something quick and easy, you can just use the auto-generated code or even consider a link-based approach that we will talk about now.

## Link-based Sign Up

By far the easiest is to just copy and paste the link given to you from the form creator. Anyone who visits this link will immediately be placed into a form hosted by MailChimp and they will take care of getting the information down for you. No need to copy and paste code at all, just hand out your link and get people to sign up!

## Manual Adding

You may be wondering why we would want to manually add people to our list. Well, in some circumstances this actually might be the most ideal option. For example, if I have been talking to potential customers/users for a while on an informal personal basis, I can always ask them “Hey, do you want to be included on our email list?” and then if they say yes, I can immediately just add them to the list myself without having them fill out any forms.

### Campaigns

When you are finally ready to send some emails back to your list, you’ll have the benefit of using MailChimp’s mail merge functions. That means if you originally collected a first name, you could send out an email that opens with “Dear [first name]” to make it seem more personal.

There is a lot more that can be talked about, but one of the more interesting benefits here is the ability to see how many people opened your email and also how many actually opened your link. After that, you can specifically target the people who seem more engaged or those that seem less engaged. This gives you a lot of power to handle communicating with your audience.

Now that we've gotten the email list collection set up, let's look at understanding our audience.
