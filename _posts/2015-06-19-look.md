The purpose of a landing page is to make people excited about your product or service. Your landing page is your chance to make a great first impression on your future customers. An ugly page makes for bad first impressions.

Now a lot of you might be thinking, "I'm a terrible graphic designer!". And that's ok! You aren't in the business of building a pretty webpage. You're in the business of selling your product to your waiting customers. Luckily for all us coders, there are tons of pretty templates already available online.

## Where to Find Templates

We recommend [Blacktie](http://www.blacktie.co). There's a lot of good ones there, but these two are specifically for a landing page: 

- [Sumo Landing – HTML & WordPress Landing Page](http://www.blacktie.co/2015/03/sumo-landing-html-wordpress-landing-page/)
- [Landing Sumo Freebie – Landing Page](http://www.blacktie.co/2014/10/landing-sumo-freebie-landing-page/)

## Making Small Adjustments

While the templates are a good start, you might need to adjust a few things here and there. This guide isn't meant to be an HTML and CSS tutorial, but we'll outline a general workflow you can use to make small changes to the look.

1. Open up `index.html` in a browser. 
2. Right click on the something you want to adjust and select **Inspect Element**.
3. Take note of the **Styles** sidebar. Play around with it in the browser until you get your desired look. The **Rules** will show you which file each property comes from.
4. Copy the changes in the browser into the appropriate file.

Now that we have our template set up, let's get some pretty images for our website.

<!-- We are going to be working with just the files `Theme/index.html` and `Theme/assets/css/style.css`.

> ### If you're wondering about the other files...
This template makes use of the [Bootstrap](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bootstrap_(front-end_framework)) front-end framework, which basically consists of HTML and CSS templates for typography, column widths, buttons, and other things to make life easier. The Bootstrap file is located at `Theme/assets/css/bootstrap.css` -->
