Now that we have a basic template for everything, you might think that we’re just about done! Having a well-designed site will prevent readers from closing the tab immediately. But now we have to keep them here. We have to be able to format and write our page in a way that can convince the reader to check out our app. The ability to write persuasively is also known as copywriting. And in this post, we’ll go over a quick summary of what this entitles.

A shout out to [Copyblogger](http://www.copyblogger.com), which is a great resource for anyone looking to learn more about this topic!

### The Purpose

A landing page should just have one purpose. Every element of this page should point towards it. In the case of an app, you want the reader to download it. This singular focus is important, because any extra information is going to take away from the reader’s attention.

### The Headline

Now that we understand the purpose of the landing page, let’s start from the top and talk about the headline. This is the first thing the user sees and is a make it or break it moment. If the user came to your page looking for one thing, but the headline speaks to something completely irrelevant, it’s likely that the user will simply close the tab.

It might seem daunting, but the headline has just one purpose: to get the user to read the first sentence of the first paragraph. And the purpose of that sentence is to get the user to read the next. And so on and so forth until we hit a point where we will ask the user to execute an action. In some cases, this might be getting the user to download your app. In other cases, it might be asking the user to fill in his or her email. This is called a “call to action”, something we will talk about in a minute.

So how should you phrase your headline? Your headline should be able to tell the user how this page can benefit him or her. The key word here is: *benefit*.

### Benefits not Features

The thing about human nature is that we don’t actually care all that much about other people and things more than ourselves. This is especially true on the internet when a limitless number of pages are vying for your attention. The one way we can capture a reader’s attention is to talk about benefits.

It is very natural to simply write about the features that your product or service has. However, people care less about what you do and more about how you can help them attain benefits for themselves.

### The Call to Action

So you have a benefit-driven headline, and every single sentence makes the reader want to read the next one. What now? Well, now it’s time to get them to commit to doing something that you want them to do. Ideally, this should happen at the point where you convinced them that they would fear missing out unless they responded to and executed your call to action.

It’s important to make this very prominent (maybe with a highly visible font or colours). We don’t want there to be any hesitation from the user. We want to make this easy for them. At the point when you think the reader should be fully convinced of the benefits that you can deliver, ask them to download your app or leave an email.

### Conclusion

There is a whole lot more that can be said about this, and I am far from an expert on this one particular topic. In fact, there are thousands of copywriters who make a full-time living simply coming up with the text to describe a product or service.
