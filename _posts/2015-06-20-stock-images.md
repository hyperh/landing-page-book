Humans are a visual species, and pictures can evoke emotion. Sometimes you can get away with having a landing page that is all screenshots, but often you’ll find that beautiful imagery can lend more attractiveness and liveliness to a page.

In this post, we will talk about where to find good stock imagery for your landing page.

### The Problem: License

Everyone knows that there are lots of beautiful images on the internet, but the biggest worry is permission. We need to know that the creator has given us permission to use it so that we don’t have to worry about any copyright or licensing issues.

### Royalty-Free is Not Always Free

Some websites advertise royalty-free images, but what this means at a very basic level is just that you are not required to pay per each time that you use the image. That doesn’t mean that you won’t be required to pay for a license to use the image at all or maybe even a requirement to show attribution for the creator.

### A Grand List

[Here](http://www.reddit.com/r/marketing/comments/2uvo8f/30_resources_for_finding_free_stock_images_for/) is a Reddit thread where many people have compiled a large list of free stock images that you can use without worry. Our personal favourites are [Unsplash](http://unsplash.com) for nature and landscape photography and [Pexels](http://www.pexels.com) for everything else.

### Size, Scale, and Resolution

A lot of these free images are super high in resolution. The best practice as of 2015 is to scale the image down to a width of 2058 pixels while maintaining the aspect ratio so the image doesn’t look skewed. If these are photographs, you should use JPEG compression to reduce the image size so that the image won’t take forever to load. Play around with it, but ideally an image size under 100kb would be ideal. For screenshots or anything with text in it, a PNG file is probably more suitable.

### A Reminder About Text

Whenever you are using text in front of an image, it is very important to make sure you have enough contrast so that people can see and read the text easily. The most common issue is the display of white text on a relatively light photograph. In these cases, I would recommend darkening the image through an image editing program like GIMP or Photoshop.
